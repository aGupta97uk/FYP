# Vertex Coloring - Greedy Coloring Heuristic
# Greedy coloring to find optimal colorings in polynomial time.
# Implementing the welsh_powell algorithm

#   TODO: 1. When graph coloring is pressed, save the existing random graph.
# Can save the nodes as a list of distinct edges. Then call the add_edge
# function to recreate the exact same graph.



#   TODO: 2. Load the graph.
#   TODO: 3. C
